# Sovereign Seas: Decentralized Voting System

## Overview
"Sovereign Seas" is a decentralized voting platform where "the ocean decides, and the vote rules the tides." Users can vote on their favorite projects within campaigns using the CELO token as the voting mechanism.

## Core Components

### Voting Mechanism

- Each CELO represents 1-5 votes (as specified by the campaign admin)
- Transparent, on-chain voting to ensure fairness and prevent manipulation

### Economic Structure
- Project fee: 15% reserved for platform operation and development
- Campaign admin fee: Variable percentage set by the campaign admin
- Remaining funds: Distributed to the wallets of winning projects

### Campaign Management
- Campaign creation: Admins can create themed campaigns
- Project submission: Users can submit projects to campaigns
- Approval process: Campaign admins approve submitted projects before they appear for voting
