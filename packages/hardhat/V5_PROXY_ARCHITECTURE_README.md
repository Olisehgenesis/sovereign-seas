# SovereignSeas V5 Proxy Architecture

## Overview

The SovereignSeas V5 Proxy Architecture is a modular redesign of the large V6 contract (3074 lines) into three focused mini contracts, all accessible through a single proxy contract. This architecture provides better maintainability, security, and development workflow while maintaining full backward compatibility.

## Architecture Components

### 1. **SovereignSeasV5Proxy.sol** (Main Proxy Contract)
- **Purpose**: Main entry point that routes all function calls to appropriate mini contracts
- **Key Features**:
  - Function routing based on function signature
  - Centralized access control and role management
  - Circuit breaker state synchronization
  - Emergency function coordination
  - UUPS upgradeability support

### 2. **ProjectManager.sol** (Project & Campaign Management)
- **Purpose**: Handles all project and campaign lifecycle operations
- **Key Functions**:
  - Project creation, updates, and ownership transfers
  - Campaign creation, updates, and admin management
  - Metadata management
  - Quick edit functions for common operations
  - V4 compatibility functions

### 3. **VotingEngine.sol** (Voting & Funding System)
- **Purpose**: Manages all voting, donation, and fund distribution operations
- **Key Functions**:
  - Fund pool creation and management
  - Donation processing
  - Voting mechanisms (V4 and V6 compatibility)
  - Fund distribution and allocation
  - Project participation tracking
  - Milestone-based funding support

### 4. **Treasury.sol** (Financial Operations)
- **Purpose**: Handles all financial operations and emergency controls
- **Key Functions**:
  - Token support management
  - Fee collection and distribution
  - Emergency withdrawal mechanisms
  - Circuit breaker functionality
  - Balance tracking and management
  - CELO and ERC20 token handling

## How It Works

### Function Routing
```
User Call ‚Üí SovereignSeasV5Proxy ‚Üí Function Router ‚Üí Appropriate Mini Contract
                ‚Üì
        State Management & Access Control
                ‚Üì
        Cross-Contract Data Coordination
```

### Data Flow Example
1. **User calls** `createProjectV6()` on the proxy
2. **Proxy routes** the call to `ProjectManager.createProjectV6()`
3. **ProjectManager** creates the project and updates its state
4. **Proxy** maintains consistency across all mini contracts
5. **User receives** the same response as if calling V6 directly

### Cross-Contract Communication
- **Proxy** coordinates state between mini contracts
- **Shared data** (like token support) is synchronized across contracts
- **Circuit breaker** state is mirrored from Treasury to Proxy
- **Events** are emitted from the appropriate mini contract

## Benefits

### üèóÔ∏è **Modularity**
- Each contract has a focused responsibility
- Easier to understand and maintain
- Clear separation of concerns

### üîí **Security**
- Smaller attack surface per contract
- Isolated vulnerabilities
- Easier security auditing

### üöÄ **Development Workflow**
- Different teams can work on different modules
- Independent testing and deployment
- Faster iteration cycles

### ‚õΩ **Gas Efficiency**
- Smaller contracts deploy faster
- More efficient upgrades
- Better gas optimization per module

### üîÑ **Upgradeability**
- Individual modules can be upgraded
- Proxy maintains backward compatibility
- UUPS upgrade pattern preserved

## Contract Sizes Comparison

| Contract | Lines of Code | Responsibility |
|----------|---------------|----------------|
| **V6 (Original)** | 3,074 | Everything |
| **ProjectManager** | ~400 | Project & Campaign Management |
| **VotingEngine** | ~450 | Voting & Funding |
| **Treasury** | ~350 | Financial Operations |
| **V5Proxy** | ~500 | Routing & Coordination |
| **Total V5** | ~1,700 | Modular Architecture |

**Reduction**: ~45% less code with better organization

## Function Mapping

### ProjectManager Functions
- `createProjectV6()`, `updateProject()`, `transferProjectOwnership()`
- `createCampaignV6()`, `updateCampaign()`, `addCampaignAdmin()`
- `getProject()`, `getCampaign()`, `getProjectCount()`

### VotingEngine Functions
- `createPool()`, `donate()`, `vote()`, `voteV4()`, `voteWithCelo()`
- `distributeCampaignFunds()`, `allocateFundsToProject()`
- `getPool()`, `getUserVoteHistory()`, `getProjectParticipation()`

### Treasury Functions
- `setTokenSupport()`, `setTokenVoting()`, `collectFees()`
- `emergencyWithdraw()`, `triggerCircuitBreaker()`, `resetCircuitBreaker()`
- `getTokenBalance()`, `getCircuitBreakerStatus()`

## Deployment

### 1. Deploy Mini Contracts
```bash
# Deploy in order
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-v5-proxy.ts --network <network>
```

### 2. Initialize Proxy
The deployment script automatically:
- Deploys all three mini contracts
- Deploys the main proxy contract
- Initializes the proxy with mini contract addresses
- Sets up proper role assignments
- Tests basic functionality

### 3. Verify Contracts
```bash
# Verify on block explorer
npx hardhat verify --network <network> <contract-address>
```

## Migration from V6

### For Users
- **No changes required** - all V6 functions work identically
- **Same function signatures** and return values
- **Same events** and state management
- **Improved gas efficiency** for most operations

### For Developers
- **Same interface** - no frontend changes needed
- **Better error handling** and debugging
- **Modular architecture** for future enhancements
- **Easier integration** with new features

## Security Features

### Access Control
- **Role-based permissions** for all operations
- **Emergency roles** for circuit breaker activation
- **Admin roles** for configuration changes
- **Manager roles** for operational functions

### Circuit Breaker
- **Emergency pause** functionality
- **Withdrawal limits** for emergency scenarios
- **State synchronization** across all contracts
- **Audit trail** for all emergency actions

### Reentrancy Protection
- **NonReentrant modifiers** on critical functions
- **Safe token transfers** using OpenZeppelin
- **State updates** before external calls

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- Individual mini contract testing
