- **Communication**: Inter-module communication via `callModule()` and `delegateToModule()`
- **Upgradeability**: Individual module upgrades without affecting others

## üéØ **System Overview & Context**

### **What is SovereignSeas?**
SovereignSeas is a decentralized funding platform where communities can create campaigns to fund projects. Think of it as a "Kickstarter meets DAO governance" system on blockchain.

### **Core Concepts**

#### **Campaigns**
- **What they are**: Funding rounds where communities vote on which projects should receive funding
- **How they work**: 
  - Admins create campaigns with specific funding goals and rules
  - Campaigns have start/end dates, funding targets, and voting mechanisms
  - Users vote for projects using various tokens (CELO, ERC20, stablecoins)
  - At the end, funds are distributed to winning projects based on voting results
- **Examples**: "Developer Projects", "local miss tourism , Community Projects", "Tech Innovation Grants"

- **Campaign Types**:
  - **CELO-based campaigns**: Traditional campaigns using CELO token
  - **Token-based campaigns**: Campaigns using specific ERC20 tokens as voting currency
  - **Multi-token campaigns**: Campaigns accepting multiple token types for voting
  - **Stablecoin campaigns**: Campaigns using stablecoins like USDC, cUSD

- **Campaign Economics**:
  - **Fee tokens**: Campaigns can set specific tokens for fee collection
  - **Fee amounts**: Fixed amounts or percentages calculated at campaign creation
  - **Project addition fees**: Cost to add projects to campaigns (in campaign token or CELO)
  - **Voting fees**: Fees charged per vote or per voting session
  - **Admin funding**: Campaigns can receive direct funding from admins

#### **Projects**
- **What they are**: Proposals submitted by users seeking funding
- **How they work**:
  - Users submit project proposals with descriptions, goals, and team info
  - Projects can be added to campaigns for voting
  - Projects have statuses (pending, verified, flagged, etc.)
  - Winning projects receive funding based on voting results
- **Examples**: "Solar Panel Installation", "Community Garden", "Educational App"

#### **Voting System**
- **Token-based voting**: Users vote using various tokens (CELO, USDC, custom ERC20)
- **Vote weighting**: Different tokens have different voting power multipliers
- **Quadratic voting**: Voting power increases with square root of token amount (prevents whale dominance)
- **Reputation system**: Users build reputation through consistent participation
- **Voter diversity**: Bonus rewards for diverse voter participation

- **Voting Mechanics**:
  - **Token weight multipliers**: Each token has a weight (1000 = 1.0x, 1500 = 1.5x voting power)
  - **Quadratic calculation**: Voting power = sqrt(token_amount) * token_weight
  - **Voter diversity bonus**: Projects with more unique voters get bonus funding
  - **Voting sessions**: Campaigns can have multiple voting rounds
  - **Vote locking**: Tokens are locked during voting period
  - **Vote verification**: System verifies token ownership and voting eligibility

- **Campaign-Specific Voting**:
  - **Campaign token voting**: Users must use the campaign's designated token
  - **Multi-token voting**: Users can choose from allowed tokens
  - **Token conversion**: Automatic conversion of other tokens to campaign token
  - **Voting power calculation**: Based on campaign token or converted equivalent

#### **Distribution Methods**
- **Equal distribution**: All projects get equal funding 
- **Proportional distribution**: Funding based on vote percentages
- **Quadratic distribution**: Rewards projects with diverse voter support
- **Custom distribution**: Admin-defined allocation rules

- **Distribution Mechanics**:
  - **Campaign token distribution**: Funds distributed in campaign's designated token
  - **Multi-token distribution**: Funds distributed in multiple tokens based on voting
  - **Conversion distribution**: Other tokens converted to campaign token for distribution
  - **Team member claims**: Project team members can claim their allocated percentages
  - **Unclaimed fund handling**: Unclaimed funds can be recalled or redistributed

### **V4 System (Monolithic Architecture)**
The original V4 system was a single large contract that handled everything:
- **All functionality in one contract**: Projects, campaigns, voting, treasury, pools all mixed together
- **Complex interactions**: Hard to maintain and upgrade
- **Gas inefficiency**: Large contract size and complex logic
- **Limited flexibility**: Hard to add new features or modify existing ones
- **Security risks**: Single point of failure
- **Scaling issues**: Difficult to handle growing complexity

### **Why V5 (Modular Architecture)?**
V5 breaks the monolithic system into specialized modules:
- **Separation of concerns**: Each module handles one specific area
- **Easier maintenance**: Smaller, focused contracts
- **Independent upgrades**: Update modules without affecting others
- **Better gas efficiency**: Optimized for specific functions
- **Enhanced security**: Isolated modules reduce attack surface
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new modules or modify existing ones
- **Developer experience**: Clearer code organization and testing

### **System Flow**
1. **Project Creation**: Users submit projects to ProjectsModule
2. **Campaign Setup**: Admins create campaigns in CampaignsModule
3. **Project Addition**: Projects are added to campaigns for voting
4. **Voting Period**: Users vote using VotingModule with various tokens
5. **Pool Management**: PoolsModule manages funding allocation
6. **Fund Distribution**: TreasuryModule handles final fund distribution
7. **Migration**: MigrationModule transfers V4 data to V5

## üîç **Design Tasks**

### **Task 1: V4 Analysis & V5 Design**

**What to do:**
- Study the V4 system structure and functionality
- Identify problems and limitations in V4
- Design modular V5 architecture to solve V4 problems

### **Task 2: Method Routing System Analysis**
The proxy uses a sophisticated call routing system:

**What the routing system does:**
- Maps function calls to the correct module
- Provides fallback routing when direct mapping fails
- Optimizes gas usage by efficient routing
- Handles different types of function calls
- Ensures calls reach the right destination

**Questions to Answer:**
