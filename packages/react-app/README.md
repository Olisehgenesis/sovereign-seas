# 🌐 VEXO.social  
**A Modular, ENS-Powered Social Identity Layer for Web3 Natives**

VEXO.social is your onchain home — a decentralized profile built on top of your ENS domain. It’s more than just a link: it’s a living, ownable smart container that holds your identity, your links, your tokens, and your social presence across the web3 world.

---

## 🚀 Overview

VEXO.social transforms your ENS (e.g. `oliseh.base.eth`) into a dynamic, composable profile:

- **vexo.social/yourname.eth** becomes your shareable social hub
- Minted from a wallet, **transferable**, **multi-access**, and **ENS-aware**
- Supports individuals, DAOs, teams, creators, and degens alike
- Profiles are smart: they can hold tokens, receive payments, and run logic
- Extensible: built to scale, plug in new features, edit modules, grow communities

---

## 🔑 Core Features

### ✅ ENS-Powered Smart Profiles
- Each link is tied to an ENS name
- Users mint their VEXO profile link with their wallet
- The link is:
  - **Transferable** or shared across multiple wallets
  - **Ownable** and **programmable** (via smart contract modules)
  - **Access-controlled** (delegated team roles or multisig)

### 🧩 Modular Social Identity
- Add/remove sections like:
  - Featured links
  - Mirror/blog posts
  - Onchain resume
  - NFTs and badges
  - Social media & contact forms
- Customize your theme, layout, and profile modules

### 🧠 ENS Awareness
- If ENS is **not renewed**, profile enters **ReadMe Mode**
  - Notifies viewers that the ENS has expired
  - Optionally redirects to a backup identity (`username.vexo.eth`)
- Profiles can be restored upon ENS reclaim by proof of ownership
