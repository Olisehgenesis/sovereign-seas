# Milestone-Based Funding System for SovereignSeas

## Overview
A milestone-based funding extension for SovereignSeas that allows projects to receive targeted grants with specific deliverable requirements, creating accountability and structured progress tracking. Supports all ERC20 tokens available on Celo ecosystem.

## Core Concept

### Traditional vs Milestone Funding
**Current SovereignSeas**: Community votes → funds distributed to winning projects → hope for good outcomes

**With Milestones**: Community/Sponsors create targeted grants → projects apply → complete specific deliverables → get paid incrementally → guaranteed outcomes

## System Architecture

### 1. Grant Types & Payment Models

#### **Payment Model Categories**

##### **Secured Grants (Upfront Payment)**
- **Definition**: Full grant amount deposited into contract before activation
- **Status**: Verified ✅ (Green badge)
- **Trust Level**: Highest - guaranteed payment upon completion

##### **Promised Grants (Deferred Payment)**
- **Definition**: Grant created without upfront deposit, payment promised for later
- **Status**: Unverified ⚠️ (Yellow warning flag)
- **Trust Level**: Lower - payment depends on creator's future ability/willingness
- **Admin Control**: Contract parameter allows/disallows creation of these grants
